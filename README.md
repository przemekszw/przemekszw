# Hi, I'm Przemek ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I am a final-year undergraduate student at the Cracow University of Economics. 
I am a final-year undergraduate student at the Cracow University of Economics. I program in Python, in which I wrote my bachelor's thesis application for displaying data received from Arduino. Additionally, I have gained a solid foundation in JavaScript and Node.js, which I had the opportunity to use while creating a data management site. In my free time, I am learning Linux and expanding my knowledge of networks. I am currently seeking opportunities for professional development in the IT industry, where I can utilize my skills and gain new experiences.
